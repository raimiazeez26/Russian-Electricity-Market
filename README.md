# Russian-Electricity-Market
## PROJECT DESCRIPTION: WHOLESALE ELECTRICITY MARKET DATASET
Addressing the high demand for power, on the 1st of September 2006, the Wholesale Electricity and
Capacity Market was launched in Russia. Now, both the price and electricity consumption forecast problem
is highly important on the Wholesale Electricity Market. Thus, the questions:

* What price should we expect tomorrow, next week, next year?
* What electricity consumption should we expect tomorrow, next week, next year?

It is important to employ analysts, ML Engineers, and Data Scientists to extract patterns from data to derive
insights that could help different aspects of the operation.
